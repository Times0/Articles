This repo stores articles for my website (https://dorian-chevalerias.com).

THe website pulls data directly from this repo, so any changes made here will be reflected on the website.

A new article should follow this simple structure:

- A folder with the article's title. The title will be beautified (writeup_digitaljustice -> Writeup Digital Justice)
- A `article.md` file containing the article's content.
- All the assets of the article should be in an `assets` folder in the article's folder. They will be automatically fetched by the website.
